  "description": "The alignment on the date picker to select the date of when a dish is cooked is off. The day-of-week headers (Su, Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa) are misaligned - 'Su' appears in the middle while 'Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa' are scrunched all the way to the right. The date numbers below are properly aligned in a 7-column grid, but the headers don't match up with their respective columns.\n\nScreenshot: Screenshot 2026-01-21 at 21.58.08.png",
