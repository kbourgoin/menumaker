# Menumaker

A fully vibe-coded app to track menu planning for my household. Not intended as production software, but an experiment to see how far I can take this.

Running live at menu.bourgoin.casa.

## Development

### Setup

The only requirement is having Bun installed - [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kbourgoin/menumaker.git
cd menumaker

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server
bun run dev
```

### Development Process

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: All changes must go through pull requests. Direct pushes to main are not allowed.**

**üß™ Critical: ALL TESTS MUST PASS LOCALLY before creating a PR. Run `bun run test:run` and ensure 100% pass rate.**

1. **Create a feature branch** from main:

   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and test locally (**REQUIRED before creating PR**):

   ```sh
   bun run dev        # Start development server
   bun run test:run   # Run tests - MUST pass all tests
   bun run lint       # Check code quality - MUST pass
   bun run build      # Test production build - MUST succeed
   ```

3. **Commit and push your branch**:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: describe your changes"
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create a pull request** on GitHub:
   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Link any related issues
   - Request review from maintainers

5. **Wait for automated checks** to pass:
   - ‚úÖ **All tests MUST pass locally before creating PR** (`bun run test:run`)
   - ‚úÖ All GitHub Actions must pass (linting, type checking, tests, build)
   - ‚úÖ All status checks must be green before merging
   - üö´ **PRs cannot be merged with failing checks**
   - üö´ **PRs with failing tests will be rejected** - Always test locally first

6. **After review, approval, and passing checks**, the PR will be merged to main

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test additions or updates

# GitHub Actions Configuration

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for automated CI/CD.

## Workflows

### `ci.yml` - Continuous Integration

Runs on every push to `main` and on all pull requests.

**Jobs:**

1. **Lint & Type Check**
   - ESLint code quality checks
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Build verification

2. **Tests**
   - Unit and integration tests using Vitest
   - Test coverage generation
   - Coverage upload to Codecov (optional)

**Features:**

- Uses Bun package manager for fast installs
- Dependency caching for improved performance
- Concurrent job execution for faster CI
- Mock environment variables for builds
- Coverage reporting integration

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used in CI:

- `CODECOV_TOKEN` (optional) - For uploading test coverage reports
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Mocked in CI for build purposes
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Mocked in CI for build purposes

## Adding Codecov Integration

To enable test coverage reporting:

1. Sign up at [codecov.io](https://codecov.io)
2. Add your repository
3. Add the `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret to your GitHub repository settings
4. Coverage reports will be automatically uploaded after test runs

## Workflow Triggers

- **Push to main**: Runs all jobs
- **Pull requests**: Runs all jobs for verification
- **Concurrency control**: Cancels in-progress runs when new commits are pushed

## Local Testing

To run the same checks locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run linting
bun run lint

# Run type checking
bunx tsc --noEmit

# Run tests
bun run test:run

# Run tests with coverage
bun run test:coverage

# Build the project
bun run build
```
