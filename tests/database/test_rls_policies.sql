-- Test 8: Verify policies use auth.uid() for user isolation
-- This is a more complex test that would require setting up auth context
-- For now, we'll check that the policies reference auth.uid()

-- Note: In a real implementation, you would test the actual policy enforcement
-- by setting up different user contexts and verifying data isolation
