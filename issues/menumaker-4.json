  "description": "After 8pm ET, today's dishes show up in both the \"Today's Menu\" section and the \"Coming Up\" section. This is almost certainly a timezone bug where UTC is being used inconsistently — after 8pm ET (which is midnight UTC), date comparisons using UTC would consider 'today' as the next day, causing today's meals to also appear in the upcoming list.",
